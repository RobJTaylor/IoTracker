# IoTracker
## IoTracker is a second year university project designed to keep track of internet of things devices.
This is the web component of the IoTracker system. For a more detailed overview see [IoTracker Java](https://github.com/RobJTaylor/IoTracker_Java). This was a collaboration with [Charlie Cross](https://github.com/AFartingHippo).

Please note: Any mySQL details are for an old server which is no longer paid for. These won't work.
